## Installation


## Usage

### To start playing in a terminal
- Open qjackctl in a window and go to the "Graph" page
- in a new Terminal window type `make repl`
- Go to the qjackctl window and connect output 1 and 2 from the "Overtone" component/server to
  the input 1 and 2 of the computer speakers
- In the clojure terminal at the user=> prompt type`(ns splice.core)`
- at the splice.core=> prompt type `(splice-start)`
- To stop, in the clojure window type `(splice-stop)`
 
### To run this form emacs using cider:
- Open qjackctl in a window and go to the "Graph" page
- in a new Terminal window type `make cider`
- Go to the qjackctl window and connect output 1 and 2 from the "Overtone" component/server to
  the input 1 and 2 of the computer speakers
- In emacs type M-x cider-connect
- Just hit <enter> at any prompts
- A clojure repl will open in an new emacs buffer. This repl is connected to the clojure server you started above
- Type `(ns core.splice)` in the emacs clojure session
- Type `(splice-start)` in the emacs clojure repl to start plating
- Type `(splice-stop)` in the emacs clojure repl to stop playing
- Type C-x k to quit the emacs cider repl. When emacs asks if you want to kill the active process type `y`
 
### Note: when defining instruments 
- :freq should always be the first param 
- :vol should always be the second param
- :release should be the param name for :envelope release time in secs
