Add midi functions from overtone/src/overtone/midi.clj
  and/or overtone/src/overtone/studio/midi.clj (possibly do this)

Implement core/splice_stop and control/stop_splice
if the nessage system is used make certain ensemble/ensemble_status.clj catches the message
  and calls stop-ensemble-status to stop the ensemble-status message loop.

Set log settings (dir and level for sc-osc

need to fix clj-osc location in sc-osc/deps.edn

check if I want to use blocking or unblocking channels in ensemble_status.clj
currently I use blocking channels if I want to switch to unblocking channels, change
(chan (* 2 (get-setting :num-players))) to (chan (buffer(* 2 (get-setting :num-players))))

Fix "wobble" at end of reverb
Check in how volume is adjusted. It seems there is some distortion on some notes
Make woosh less predictable

If an instrument has a variable release, like woosh, it needs to be taken into account when scheduling
note-off events or even just when calling get-release-millis-from-instrument

It seems there is a lot of time between the event time and the note play time (not for rests)


-------- LONG TERM --------

Do not make a new synth for every note keep 1 synth and retrigger it
Move sc-osc to a seperate repo and use submodules
Convert to use groups to be able to set execution time
