Add midi functions from overtone/src/overtone/midi.clj
  and/or overtone/src/overtone/studio/midi.clj (possibly do this)

Implement core/splice_stop and control/stop_splice
if the nessage system is used make certain ensemble/ensemble_status.clj catches the message
  and calls stop-ensemble-status to stop the ensemble-status message loop.

Set log settings (dir and level for sc-osc

need to fix clj-osc location in sc-osc/deps.edn

check if I want to use blocking or unblocking channels in ensemble_status.clj
currently I use blocking channels if I want to switch to unblocking channels, change
(chan (* 2 (get-setting :num-players))) to (chan (buffer(* 2 (get-setting :num-players))))
