Add midi functions from overtone/src/overtone/midi.clj
  and/or overtone/src/overtone/studio/midi.clj (possibly do this)

Implement core/splice_stop and control/stop_splice
if the nessage system is used make certain ensemble/ensemble_status.clj catches the message
  and calls stop-ensemble-status to stop the ensemble-status message loop.

Set log settings (dir and level for sc-osc

need to fix clj-osc location in sc-osc/deps.edn

check if I want to use blocking or unblocking channels in ensemble_status.clj
currently I use blocking channels if I want to switch to unblocking channels, change
(chan (* 2 (get-setting :num-players))) to (chan (buffer(* 2 (get-setting :num-players))))

Why do we send 2 "release" msgs for most note-offs
  [ "/s_new", "string-sect", 41, 1, 2, "freq", 587.33, "vol", 0.137436, "attack", 2.5, "release", 3 ]
  [ "/s_get", 41, "release" ]
  [ "/s_get", 41, "release" ]
  [ "/s_new", "string-sect", 42, 1, 2, "freq", 659.255, "vol", 0.326907, "attack", 5.5, "release", 4.7 ]
  [ "/s_get", 42, "release" ]
  [ "/s_new", "woosh", 43, 1, 2, "freq", 73.4162, "vol", 0.2 ]
  [ "/n_set", 41, "gate", 0 ]
  [ "/n_set", 42, "gate", 0 ]
Fix "wobble" at end of reverb
Check in how volume is adjusted. It seems there is some distortion on some notes
